# Automatic Code Grader

This is the third and final project for my software architecture class at Lebanon Valley College.

The automatic code grader is exactly what it sounds like: it is a tool which allows students to 
submit code for assignments and have it automatically graded. Specifically, this project is the 
front-end, written in Dart and using the Flutter UI framework. The UI is cross platform, but
looks best on a desktop web browser. The app allows three types of users to log in.

1. Students can log in to see their pending assignments, and submit code. They can also view past grades.
2. Instructors can log in to upload new assignments or view the grades of students who have already submitted.
3. Admins can log in to add and remove users.

Note: This is only the user interface for the Automatic Code Grader. To actually run the project in its 
entirety, the backend server must be running and hooked up to an instance of Memgraph. I did not
contribute to the backend code.

I did not write all this code myself. The other contributors were [Brandon Bauer](https://github.com/btb002), [Adam Rilatt](https://github.com/ajrilatt), [Cooper Vohs](https://github.com/booperxd), and [Conor Pettis-Yarnall](https://github.com/conorPY), who were my teammates.
