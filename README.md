# Automatic Code Grader

This is the third and final project for my software architecture class at Lebanon Valley College.

Note: This is the User Interface for the Automatic Code Grader. To actually run the project in its 
entirety, the backend server must be running and hooked up to an instance of Memgraph.

I did not write all this code myself. The other contributors were [Brandon Bauer](https://github.com/btb002), [Adam Rilatt](https://github.com/ajrilatt), [Cooper Vohs](https://github.com/booperxd), and [Conor Pettis-Yarnall](https://github.com/conorPY), who were my teammates.
